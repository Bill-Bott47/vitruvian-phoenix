/**
 * Vitruvian Hardware Detection
 *
 * Previously attempted to identify hardware models (Euclid, Trainer+) from device name prefixes,
 * but this approach was flawed - device name patterns don't reliably indicate hardware capabilities.
 *
 * Current approach: Report only what we can actually detect (device name) and avoid making
 * assumptions about capabilities. True capability detection would require reading firmware
 * version from the device, which is not currently implemented.
 *
 * The VERSION BLE characteristic (UUID: 74e994ac-0e80-4c02-9cd0-76cb31d3959b) contains
 * hardware/firmware info but the parsing format is undocumented.
