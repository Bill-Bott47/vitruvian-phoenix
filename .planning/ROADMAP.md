# Roadmap: Project Phoenix MP

## Milestones

- **v0.4.0 Foundation** - Phases 0 (pre-GSD, shipped)
- **v0.4.1 Architectural Cleanup** - Phases 1-4 (shipped 2026-02-13)
- **v0.4.2 BLE Layer Decomposition** - Phases 5-12 (in progress)

## Overview

Decompose the 2,886-line KableBleRepository monolith into 8 focused, testable modules while preserving the BleRepository interface contract. Each phase extracts one logical subsystem, ordered by risk (zero-risk extractions first, high-risk connection management last). The facade pattern keeps the public API stable while internal complexity drops 80%+.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Phases 1-4: v0.4.1 Architectural Cleanup (completed)
- Phases 5-12: v0.4.2 BLE Layer Decomposition (current milestone)
- Decimal phases (e.g., 5.1): Urgent insertions if needed

  2. All timing constants (timeouts, intervals, thresholds) centralized in one file
  3. Build compiles on both Android and iOS targets
  4. No functional changes to BLE behavior
**Plans**: 1 plan

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Protocol parsing functions (parseRepPacket, parseMonitorPacket, parseDiagnosticPacket, parseHeuristicPacket) callable without BLE connection
  2. Unit tests verify byte parsing matches monolith behavior for all packet formats
  3. Legacy 6-byte and modern 24-byte rep notification formats both parse correctly
  4. Byte utilities (getUInt16LE, getInt16LE, etc.) are pure functions
**Plans**: 2 plans
  - [ ] 06-01-PLAN.md (TDD) - Create ProtocolParser.kt with byte utilities and tests
  - [ ] 06-02-PLAN.md - Add packet parsers, update KableBleRepository to use extracted functions

### Phase 7: BleOperationQueue
**Goal**: BLE read/write serialization extracted with Mutex pattern
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: QUEUE-01, QUEUE-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All BLE reads and writes pass through single BleOperationQueue
  2. Concurrent BLE operations cannot interleave (Issue #222 prevention)
  3. Integration test verifies no fault 16384 under concurrent access
  4. Write retry logic (3 attempts) preserved
**Plans**: 1 plan
  - [ ] 07-01-PLAN.md - Extract BleOperationQueue, update KableBleRepository to use queue

### Phase 8: DiscoMode + Interface
**Goal**: Disco mode easter egg self-contained, concrete cast eliminated
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: DISCO-01, IFACE-01, IFACE-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. DiscoMode.start() cycles LED colors correctly on connected device
  2. DiscoMode.stop() restores last color scheme
  3. setLastColorSchemeIndex() available on BleRepository interface
  4. SettingsManager no longer casts to KableBleRepository (Issue #144 fixed)
**Plans**: 1 plan
  - [ ] 08-01-PLAN.md — Extract DiscoMode.kt, add interface method, fix SettingsManager cast

### Phase 9: HandleStateDetector
**Goal**: 4-state handle detection machine extracted and testable
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: HAND-01, HAND-02, HAND-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. HandleStateDetector implements WaitingForRest -> Released -> Grabbed -> Moving state machine
  2. Overhead pulley baseline tracking works (Issue #176 fix preserved)
  3. Just Lift autostart mode detects handle grab correctly
  4. First rep always registers after workout start (baseline initialized correctly)
  5. Unit tests cover all state transitions with synthetic metrics
**Plans**: 2 plans
  - [ ] 09-01-PLAN.md (TDD) — Create HandleStateDetector with 25+ unit tests for all state transitions
  - [ ] 09-02-PLAN.md — Wire KableBleRepository delegation, remove inline handle state logic

  4. Status flag processing (deload, ROM violation) works correctly
**Plans**: 2 plans
  - [ ] 10-01-PLAN.md (TDD) -- Create MonitorDataProcessor with ~30 unit tests for processing pipeline
