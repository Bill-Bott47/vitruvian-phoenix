# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-15)

**Core value:** Users can connect to their Vitruvian trainer and execute workouts reliably on both platforms.
**Current focus:** Phase 12 COMPLETE - KableBleConnectionManager + Facade (pending manual BLE verify)

## Current Position

Phase: 12 of 12 (KableBleConnectionManager + Facade)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase - COMPLETE (pending manual BLE verification checkpoint)
Status: Plan 12-02 complete, awaiting manual BLE device testing
Last activity: 2026-02-16 — Completed 12-02-PLAN.md (facade delegation)

Progress: [####################] 100% (12/12 phases)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 14 (v0.4.2 milestone)
- Average duration: 9 min
- Total execution time: 2.14 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 05-ble-protocol-constants | 1 | 10min | 10min |
| 06-protocol-parser | 2 | 14min | 7min |
| 07-ble-operation-queue | 1 | 8min | 8min |
| 08-disco-mode-interface | 1 | 6min | 6min |
| 09-handle-state-detector | 2 | 26min | 13min |
| 10-monitor-data-processor | 2 | 18min | 9min |
| 11-metric-polling-engine | 2/2 | 20min | 10min |
| 12-ble-connection-facade | 2/2 | 14min | 7min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 11-01 (12min), 11-02 (8min), 12-01 (7min), 12-02 (7min)
- Trend: Consistent execution ~8min average

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v0.4.1]: WorkoutCoordinator as zero-method state bus
- [v0.4.1]: bleErrorEvents SharedFlow for BLE->DWSM communication
- [v0.4.1]: Feature-scoped Koin modules with verify()
- [v0.4.2]: 8-module decomposition pattern (no DI changes)
- [05-01]: Nested object pattern for BleConstants.Timing and BleConstants.Thresholds
- [05-01]: Pre-built Kable characteristic references in BleConstants
- [06-01]: Top-level pure functions for byte utilities (emphasize statelessness)
- [06-01]: toVitruvianHex extension (avoids shadowing stdlib)
- [06-02]: Two-tier packet format detection in parseRepPacket (Issue #210 compliance)
- [06-02]: Null return for invalid/short packet data instead of throwing
- [07-01]: BleOperationQueue as class not object (supports future multi-device)
- [07-01]: writeSimple() for internal ops without retry (heartbeat)
- [07-01]: bleQueue property inline (no DI per v0.4.2 decision)
- [08-01]: Callback-based design for DiscoMode (suspend (ByteArray) -> Unit avoids circular dependency)
- [08-01]: Interface method with default no-op for setLastColorSchemeIndex()
- [08-01]: Connection guard stays in KableBleRepository, not DiscoMode
- [09-01]: currentTimeMillis() expect/actual for default timeProvider (not kotlinx-datetime)
- [09-01]: Remove legacy dead code (forceAboveGrabThresholdStart/forceBelowReleaseThresholdStart)
- [09-01]: Extract isAboveThreshold/isBelowThreshold helpers for baseline-relative detection
- [09-02]: handleDetector property inline (no DI) matching bleQueue and discoMode delegation pattern
- [09-02]: stopPolling() reads handleDetector.minPositionSeen/maxPositionSeen/isAutoStartMode directly
- [09-02]: enableHandleDetection() calls handleDetector.enable() before startMonitorPolling()
- [10-01]: EMA cold start: seed with first real velocity (lastTimestamp > 0), not first-ever zero
- [10-01]: Position range constants as companion vals (avoid repeated Int.toFloat() on hot path)
- [10-01]: calculateRawVelocity() helper eliminates A/B duplication in velocity calculation
- [10-02]: Keep both RomViolationType enums (processor + repository) and map in callback for API stability
- [10-02]: monitorProcessor declared after SharedFlow properties for init-order safety
- [10-02]: Complete 4-module delegation: bleQueue, discoMode, handleDetector, monitorProcessor all inline properties
- [11-01]: Test helpers (startFakeJobs) for lifecycle testing without Peripheral dependency
- [11-01]: stopDiscoMode stays in KableBleRepository, engine doesn't reference DiscoMode
- [11-01]: Connection state check uses coroutine isActive, not _connectionState flow
- [11-01]: onConnectionLost launched in separate coroutine to avoid cancelling polling coroutine mid-cleanup
- [11-02]: pollingEngine declared LAST among delegated modules (after bleQueue, handleDetector, monitorProcessor) for init-order safety
- [11-02]: parseDiagnosticData stays in KableBleRepository (simplified, no fault-change tracking) for post-CONFIG one-shot reads
- [11-02]: stopDiscoMode() placed before engine calls in enableHandleDetection, restartMonitorPolling, startActiveWorkoutPolling, startObservingNotifications
- [11-02]: Complete 5-module delegation: bleQueue, discoMode, handleDetector, monitorProcessor, pollingEngine
- [12-01]: lastReportedState tracking variable for stopScanning guard (avoids needing facade state)
- [12-01]: processIncomingData/parseDiagnosticData made internal for testability (MetricPollingEngine pattern)
- [12-01]: Self-contained _commandResponses SharedFlow + external callback dual emission for awaitResponse
- [12-01]: Removed emoji characters from log messages for cleaner logging
- [12-02]: lateinit + init block for connectionManager to break Kotlin compiler recursive type inference
- [12-02]: Device name/address omitted from facade logRepo.debug calls (ConnectionManager owns that context)
- [12-02]: Complete 6-module delegation: bleQueue, discoMode, handleDetector, monitorProcessor, pollingEngine, connectionManager
